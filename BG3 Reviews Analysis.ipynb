    "●\tHandle Missing Values: I ran for all null values, found that they were only located in the 'Review' column. I left them as is because I extracted the number of reviews that contained a rating out of 1 to 10/10 to use for the analysis of recommendations. I also left them as they would screw the numbers for the method of access that I graphed at the end of the analysis. This resulted in a dictionary with the number of ratings for each 1 to 10/10. \n",

    "○\tExplain why you did this drop, fill, etc.: I left the data as is, as I am looking for the score out of 10 that the reviewer left those without a review or a score are not counted in the analysis. I am also looking to compare the number of free versions vs purchases that were reviewed. \n",

    "●\tFeature Engineering: Created a new column by turning the boolean from 'steam_purchase' and 'received_for_free' to a string of steam or free, then combined the columns to one to get a single graphical representation of the method of access from the dataset. I had to rename the rows that either combined to SteamFree or were null, to both or no response. This can be seen in the below graph. \n",
